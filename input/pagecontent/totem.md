### Care Pathway Overview

TOTeM stands for Transmurale Opvolging met TeleMonitoring na chirurgie.

Improved surgical techniques allow patients to go home earlier and earlier after their surgery. Complications are possible with any surgery. It is important that they are noticed in time so that the necessary action can be taken by the appropriate healthcare provider.

TOTeM aims to send patients home after surgery as early as medically possible, with quality and specialised follow-up in the home environment. 

The patient can recover in a familiar environment and is more involved in the recovery process. For the hospital, faster discharge offers the opportunity to optimise length of stay and bed occupancy. The social cost of care falls.

With support from the FPS Public Health, some TOTeM projects are being rolled out in 6 hospitals in a pilot project; and this for specific types of surgery (depending on the hospital's choice): colon surgery, obesity surgery, kidney surgery, bladder surgery, pancreatic surgery and anti-reflux surgery.
