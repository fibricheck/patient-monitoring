### Intellectual Property Considerations

While this implementation guide and the underlying FHIR are licensed as public domain, this guide includes examples making use of terminologies such 
as LOINC, SNOMED CT and others which have more restrictive licensing requirements. Implementers should make themselves familiar with licensing and 
any other constraints of terminologies, questionnaires, and other components used as part of their implementation process. In some cases, 
licensing requirements may limit the systems that data captured using certain questionnaires may be shared with.
