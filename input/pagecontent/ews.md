### Process and Workflow Description

#### Start-Up

- **Screening and risk Assessment**: performed by the attending physician.
- **Informed consent**: Collected and securely stored.
- **Tele Care Center**: Involved in the workflow.
- **Parameters monitored**:

  - Heart Rate (HR)
  - Systolic Blood Pressure (BP)
  - Saturation
  - Temperature
  - Respiratory Rate
  - Oxygen
  - AWPU
    - Frequency: Daily, 3 times per day, 10 days.

#### Data Collection

- Data is automatically collected via connected devices or manually entered into the system.
- Technology is CE-certified, with end-to-end encryption and GDPR compliance.

#### Alarm Management

- (N)EWS and/or single vital sign alarm thresholds are predefined on the digital platform.
- The RRT/tele care center checks the collected data daily during working hours.
- In case of alarms, the tele care center will inform the home nurse as soon as possible.
