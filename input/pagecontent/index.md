### Introduction

This Implementation Guide (IG) provides standardized guidance for Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems and Telemonitoring (TM) Providers. Developed in alignment with HL7 standards, it offers a unified framework for seamless data integration between EHRs and TM Providers. The guide is fully aligned with the Telemonitoring Prescription initiative. Additional information can be found at [telemonitoring-prescription.com](https://www.telemonitoring-prescription.com).

### Purpose

The primary goal of this IG is to standardize the use of FHIR outputs within the Telemonitoring Hub. By providing clear guidelines, it ensures that EHR systems can effectively interpret data sent by Telemonitoring Providers and received by prescribers (typically EHR systems). This facilitates streamlined and consistent communication across the healthcare ecosystem.

### Scope

The Telemonitoring Prescription focuses on integrating patient monitoring data into hospital and healthcare systems, regardless of where the data is collectedâ€”inside or outside a hospital. This guide emphasizes interoperability between hospital systems and external providers, ensuring that patient monitoring outcomes are seamlessly incorporated into clinical workflows.

### Topics Covered

- **Use Cases and Scenarios**: Practical examples to demonstrate the implementation of Telemonitoring in real-world settings.
- **Key Concepts and Definitions**: Clear explanations of core terms and concepts relevant to the Telemonitoring Prescription.
- **Interoperability**: Guidelines for achieving seamless data exchange between EHRs and TM Providers.
- **FHIR Profiles and Terminology Bindings**: Detailed specifications for consistent use of FHIR standards.
- **Sample Resources**: Examples of FHIR resources to facilitate implementation.
- **Security and Privacy**: Best practices for ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and securing patient data.
- **Implementation Guidance**:
  - Handling errors and exceptions
  - Best practices for deployment and integration

This guide serves as a critical resource for ensuring the success of the Telemonitoring Prescription initiative by promoting consistency, interoperability, and security in patient monitoring data exchange.
